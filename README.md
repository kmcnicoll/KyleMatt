# Analyzing 2015 Kings County WA housing data to understand what features in the housing market effect price. 

# The goal
The aim of this project is to assess data provided on the Kings County housing market and use a multilinear model to understand what features of a house, such as location, as well as apsects of the house itself have the most significant effect on price.  

# Statistical tests used
Our project focused on one major question, how can we accurately predict housing prices. In order to answer this we used a series of linear regression models on specific features as well as experimented with ridge and lasso regression models to better understand instances of collinearity between the features. In addition, we enginneered features to better analyze the significance of their effect. 



# Further Study
We would like to further study each zipcode's population, and how income is broken down within each zipcode. Along with this, we'd like to study the type of markets available within each zipcode along with geography to see how those factors effect price in tandum with features of the house
