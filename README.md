# Using Data from Kings County Seattle to create a model to create housing prices

# The goal
The aim of this project is to use data provided on the Kings County housing market to create a multilinear model that can predict any given houses price.

# Statistical tests used
Our project focused on one major question, how can we accurately predict housing prices. In order to answer this we used a linear regression model with a multitude of other tests to support and improve it.





# Future Applications and Importance
With a uncertain economy and in a world that values marketing over value it is important for future home buyers and even home sells to know how much their property is worth.
